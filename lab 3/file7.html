            Typography is the art of arranging text to make it clear and visually appealing. It includes choosing fonts, sizes, spacing, and alignment. Key elements:
            I- Fonts: Styles of text like Arial or Times New Roman.
            II- Hierarchy: Making headings stand out from body text.
            III- Spacing: Adjusting gaps between letters, lines, and words.
